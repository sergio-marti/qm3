1) make a local copy of "confing.sample" into "config":

    cp config.sample config

2) edit "config" and change your system variables accordingly:

PYX           python interpreter
PYL           python development library (include the corresponding path with "-L")
SHD           gfortran linker option for creating shared/dynamic libraries
MTH           linear algebra version (version identifier)
MLB           linear algebra library library and path
MPI           C mpi compiler with the corresponding keyword for creating shared/dynamic libraries

The following variables should point to the paths of the different external programs
in order to compile a shared version (ctypes).

DFTB XTB DFTD4 DFTD4_INC AMBER

3) edit "setup/*" files (mostly plumed and sander), and change the paths of the external programs

4) compile the standard distribution:

    make

5) optionally, compile additional stuff:

    make mpi

    make plumed
    make sander

    make dftb.so
    make xtb.so
    make dftd4.so
    make sqm.so
