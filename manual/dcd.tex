\subsection[dcd]{dcd.py}
The class \func{dcd} provides
minimal methods for reading and writing XPLOR-based trajectory files (DCD). The main variables/attributes are
the number of atoms (\parm{natm}) and the current frame pointer (\parm{curr}).
The \func{open\_read} and \func{open\_write} methods are intended
only for initialisation, and \func{next}/\func{append} will perform the reading/writing sutff on the coordinates
of the molecule object provided as an argument (\parm{molec}).
The final number of frames in the trajectory is updated after the \func{close} method is called.\\
\begin{pyglist}[language=python,fvset={frame=single}]
class dcd( fname = None, qprint = True )
    natm = 0
	curr = 0
    def open_read( fname, qprint = True )
    def next( molec )
    def goto( num )
    def open_write( fname, natoms, sele = None )
    def append( molec )
    def close()
\end{pyglist}
